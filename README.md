Homework Project for Deep Learning 
We choose to use the FairFace dataset in our homework. (https://github.com/joojs/fairface)
I will provide a google drive link here so you can dowload the dataset through the google colab. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CPnuKVxtekzKgGzWLGDC6top2DcqgnNZ?usp=sharing)
In this repo you can see the google colab which contains all the steps.
